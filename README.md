Crop Weed Detection using YOLO and CNN

This repository contains the implementation of a crop weed detection system using two popular deep learning models: YOLO (You Only Look Once) and CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks). Aim is to accurately distinguish between crops and weeds to aid in automated weeding systems, enhancing agricultural productivity and reducing the need for manual labor.

Models

YOLO

YOLO is a state-of-the-art object detection system that is fast and accurate. It frames object detection as a single regression problem, straight from image pixels to bounding box coordinates and class probabilities.


CNN

Convolutional Neural Networks are a class of deep learning algorithms particularly well-suited for image recognition and classification tasks. Our CNN model has achieved high accuracy in distinguishing between crops and weeds.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of labeled images of crops and weeds. Each image has been annotated with bounding boxes and class labels indicating whether the region contains crops or weeds.

Results

CNN: Achieved an accuracy of 95.75% in detecting crops and weeds.

YOLO: Achieved an accuracy of 82% in detecting crops and weeds.
